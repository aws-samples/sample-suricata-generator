# Suricata Rule Generator - Python Requirements
#
# Core application uses only Python standard library modules:
# - tkinter (usually included with Python)
# - re, os, json, ipaddress, typing, urllib
#
# Optional dependencies for enhanced features:

# Advanced Editor with Code Folding (optional)
# Required for Tools > Advanced Editor (Ctrl+E) to use wxPython/Scintilla-based editor
# If not installed, Advanced Editor will prompt user with installation instructions
# The main application works fine without this - only needed for Advanced Editor
wxPython>=4.2.0

# Installation:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Or install wxPython separately:
# pip install wxPython
#
# Note: wxPython is only required if you want to use the Advanced Editor feature.
# The main tkinter-based application works without it.
